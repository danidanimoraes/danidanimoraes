### Hellooooo!

My name is Daniele, and I'm from Brazil! 💚 💛

I graduated in Electrical Engineering 🔌⚡ at Universidade Estudal de Campinas (UNICAMP), buuuut I've worked with software development since my graduation 😛

During the course, I programmed with assembly and C... very low-level...  
Then, I began working with C++...  
Moved to a new project and learned Java ☕...  
Landed on a front-end project with Angular...  
Got on another project with older technologies: angularJS/Primefaces...  
And currently I am working at iFood 🍰, the biggest Foodtech in Latin America, with React ☺️  

Because of this, my github is kind of messy, because I like to always learn new stuff! 

🍭 Fun fact: I also like to learn new languages, currently I'm studying Arabic and Brazilian Sign Language

Enjoy and feel free to contact me! ✉️
